Images must be monochrome gray-scale for halftoning. Use images with even numbr of pixels along each axis is a power of 2 eg 1024x1024.

The DFT is computed, independent quantization with error-diffuced halftoning with the diffusion 
weights specified by Floyd and Steinberg.

The Images folder contains images. Image 1, Image 2 and Image 3 were used for the DigitalHalftoning and the other image used for Halftone removal.
