# DigitalHalftoning
The code converts photographs to bitonal images.. 

Images must be monochrome gray-scale for halftoning. Use images with even numbr of pixels along each axis is a power of 2 eg 1024x1024.

The DFT is computed, independent quantization with error-diffuced halftoning with the diffusion 
weights specified by Floyd and Steinberg.
